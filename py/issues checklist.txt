if your here you probably just ran a command that didnt work. here are the troubleshooting steps:

#Reason One
Check your client.command. make sure there are parenthasis after it. make sure there is an @ before it

Should look like this:
@client.command()


#Reason Two
Check for spelling errors


#Reason Three 
Check to make sure you have parameters


#Reason Four
Check to make sure you have "await" before your command


#Reason Five
Check to make sure you have a colon after your function is specified
