# discord-bot2.0
i actually understand code now so this will be interesting


3/29/22
repo is set up and dpy is installed
just reading the docs to learn how to acutally use discord.py. hoping its easier then discord.js
took 3 days to get discord.py to actually work so thats nice. everyone was relatively helpful and helped me solve a specific issue. only need to figure out how to hide the token and i can make the repo open. ok its whatever ill just make it priv.
